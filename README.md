# Dashboard with React, ApexCharts, React Router, and Material UI

This is a modern dashboard application built using React, ApexCharts for data visualization, React Icons for UI elements, React Router for navigation, and Material UI for styling. The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to visualize data and navigate between different views.

## Features

- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Use of ApexCharts to create responsive and interactive charts.
- **Navigation**: React Router for seamless navigation between different pages or sections of the dashboard.
- **Modern UI Components**: Built using Material UI for clean and modern design elements.
- **Icons**: Integrated React Icons for visual enhancements.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Frontend JavaScript framework for building the UI.
- **ApexCharts**: Charting library to display data visualizations.
- **React Router**: For routing and navigation between different components.
- **Material UI**: A UI framework for responsive and accessible components.
- **React Icons**: For adding scalable icons to the UI.

Usage
Once the app is up and running, you can explore different sections of the dashboard, each featuring interactive charts and responsive UI components. Use the navigation bar (created using React Router) to move between pages.

Dashboard: The main page with data visualizations.

Page 2: An additional page for other metrics or data.

Settings: Configure and customize dashboard preferences (if implemented).

Customization
You can easily customize the following aspects of the dashboard:

Charts: Modify the chart data and configuration inside src/components/Charts to display your own datasets.

Routes: Add or remove routes in src/App.js to modify the navigation flow.

UI: Update Material UI components in src/components to adjust the design to your liking.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
